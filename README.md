## Real-Time Urban Mobility Demand Forecasting

Urban transportation constantly seeks a delicate balance: maximizing customer satisfaction and driver utilization while minimizing wait times. This becomes even more challenging during peak demand periods. This project explores how machine learning can help bridge this gap.

Drawing inspiration from the challenges of optimizing driver utilization and customer satisfaction alongside the need for fair and adaptable pricing models, especially during high-demand periods, I investigated how machine learning can address the following critical research questions:

- 1.	Optimizing Demand and Response: How can machine learning streamline driver dispatch to elevate customer satisfaction and minimize wait times?

- 2.	Dynamic Pricing for a Balanced Ecosystem: Can machine learning-driven pricing strategies balance resource allocation, user affordability, and driver motivation during peak demand periods?
